What needs to be done:
A lot! This was mostly a coding excercise working with a software that I interact with almost daily (Discord).
This project will be continiously worked on as I learn more and think of new things to add. Of course, there is always
room for optimization improvements, formatting, more documentation, DRYing the code and much more!
